# LinkCamp - Server

🛡️ The backend power behind **LinkCamp**, providing secure authentication, admin moderation, cloud-based media management, and a fully role-based API system.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **User & Admin Authentication:**
  - Dual JWT verification for user and admin roles.
  - Firebase Authentication support.

- **Account Verification Workflow:**
  - New student/teacher signups are pending until approved by an Admin.

- **Profile Management:**
  - First-time login triggers a profile creation (image + display name).

- **Role-Based Content Control:**
  - Admins can approve users, delete or dismiss reported posts.

- **Post Management:**
  - Create, edit, delete, report, comment
  - Authority posts and teacher announcements have limited interaction to maintain content authenticity.

- **Secure Image Uploads:**
  - User-uploaded images are stored on Cloudinary via Multer middleware.

- **Error Handling:**
  - Robust error messages and status codes for every API.

- **Cross-Origin Support:**  
  CORS enabled to communicate securely with the frontend.
